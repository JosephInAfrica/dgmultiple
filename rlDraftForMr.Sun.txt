Letter of Recommendation for Li Jiajun's Graduate Program Application

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Li Jiajun, a former student of mine, for admission to your esteemed Computer Science program. I am Professor Sun Xiquan of the Chemistry College at Qingdao University, where I teach various courses.

Although ten years have passed since I lectured him, I still remember him well. He performed exceptionally well in my natural product and spectrum analysis classes, showcasing not only intelligence but also a keen interest in the subjects.

What particularly impressed me about Li's academic journey was his involvement in extra-curricular lab projects. He dedicated a lot of time to these endeavors. One project that stands out involved the plastination of specimens, a topic that Li approached with enthusiasm and diligence. He demonstrated his technical skills and yielded remarkable results.

Li impressed me with his proficiency in the English language. During one summer vacation, Li devoted his time to preparing for the TOEFL exam, and he aced it, demonstrating his ability to learn quickly and his passion for challenges.

Currently, Li generously offers his time and expertise to guide my current students on the programming aspects of their projects. He is kind-hearted and always ready to lend a hand.

While Li majored in chemistry, I am confident that his solid training in science and research will serve as a strong foundation for his pursuit in the field of Computer Science.

In conclusion, I strongly recommend Mr. Li for admission to your Computer Science program. I am sure his intelligence, diligence, and passion will make him an excellent candidate.

Sincerely,

Prof. Sun Xiquan
