Letter of Recommendation

Applicant: Li Jiajun
Recommender: Prof. Sun Xiquan

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Li Jiajun, a former student of mine, for admission to your esteemed Computer Science program. I am Prof. Sun Xiquan of the Chemistry College at Qingdao University, where I had the pleasure of teaching Li in various courses.

Although ten years has passed since I gave him lecturers, I still remember him well. He did really well in my natural product and spectrum analysis classes, show not only intelligence but also keen interest in the subjects.

What particularly impressed me about Li's academic journey was his involvement in extra-curricular lab projects. He dedicated a lof of time to these endeavors. One project I still remember involved the plastination of specimens, a topic that Li approached with enthusiasm and diligence. He demonstrated his technical skills in it and yielded remarkable results.

Li impressed me with his proficiency in English languae. Li once spent one summer vacation preparing the TOEFL exam. He aced it, showing he could learn fast and had the passion for challenges. 

Currently, Li is generously offering his time and expertise to guide my current students on the programming aspects of their projects. He's kind-hearted and is always ready to lend a hand.

While Li's majored in chemistry, I am confident that the solid training in science and research will serve as a strong foundation for his pursuit in Computer Science area. 

In conclusion, I strongly recommend Mr. Li for admission to your Computer Science program. I am sure his intelligence, deligence and passion will make him a good candidate.

Sincerely,

Prof. Sun Xiquan
