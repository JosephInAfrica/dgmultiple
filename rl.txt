Dear admission Committee,

I am writing to recommend Li Jiajun for admission to your esteemed institution. I had the pleasure of working with Li Jiajun at Digitalor Ltd, a Shenzhen-based technology company that specializes in tracing and protection solutions for IT assets. During his tenure as a backend programmer from 2009-2010, I was his project manager and team leader.

Li Jiajun is an enthusiastic and reliable individual who impressed me with his efficiency and ability to work under pressure. I recall a time when we were preparing to demonstrate a newly developed sensor product at a trade fair. A demonstration software was required to be ready as soon as possible to make it available for demonstration. This was quite a challenge since a new communication protocol was applied. Li Jiajun managed to finish the demo within two weeks. It was simple, elegant, and worked flawlessly throughout the fair event. I really appreciate his ability to work under pressure and deliver without compromising on quality.

Li Jiajunâ€™s growth in skills also impressed me a lot. He learned Go programming language by himself and found good use of it in his work. I can see his curiosity in tech trends, and I really appreciate his passion for always learning.

I also give high recommendation on his creativity in problem-solving. There are times when we need to answer personalized demands by individual customers. Li Jiajun would try to find generalized solutions and integrate them into our product. He has a down-to-earth personality and is practical in problem-solving. He gives practical advice and carries them out with quality.

I hope this letter provides you with the information you need to make an informed decision. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.

Sincerely, Kitty Chan
