#Personal Statement


My name is JiaJun Lee, age 31. I am a senior backend developer working at Oppo in China. I am aiming to attend Texas A&M University's Computer Science graduate program.

The reason for me to depart from my work and go back to study is that I want to delve deeper into computer science and expand my career path further. 
I am a self-taught programmer, I majored in Chemistry in University. As I  My desire of learning it systematicaly drives me to apply for this master programme, as TAMU is well reputated in this field and has the edge in many frontiers such as AI, xx and xx.# I have picked up pieces of knowledge in areas like algorithms,operating systems and design patterns, and even dwelled on some topics in quite some depth. Yet I have strong desire to catch up foundamental knowledge systematically, and deep even further into Operating Systems, the most delicate compilation of designs and patterns, the practises combining practics with theory. The most down-to-earth yet most sophiscated coding practises.


As for my background, I was a chemistry student at Qindao University 10 years ago. Driven by intrinsic passion and romanticism, I tired to . The golden decade of IT industry surges in China drove me to become a self-taught programmer. At first, I picked up Python and wrote some scrawler programs for marketing potential customers at a logistics company just out of interest. Then I became a full-time developer in a sensors manufacture company where I learned how to programme using Go and for the first time created real industry software for cluster receptors management. With this experience, I got enrolled by Oppo, the smart phone company, and have worked there ever since as a backend service developer. My job is to provide services for security management mainly in anti-intrusion and anti-reverse-engineering. Overall, my language tool kits contents Python,Go,MySQL,HTML,CSS,FLask etc.

With my work experience, I am confident that i am qualified for this master program. I wish this education supplement could relieve me from the idea# of 'What if i had learned CS from the basics'#. I want to study this from an academic perspective to gain an #全局的系统的认知和视角.
