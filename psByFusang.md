#Personal Statement


My name is JiaJun Lee, age 31. I am a senior backend developer working at Oppo in China. I am aiming to attend Texas A&M University's Computer Science graduate program.

The reason for me to depart from my work and go back to study is that I want to delve deeper into computer science and expand my career path further. 
I am a self-taught programmer, I majored in Chemistry in University.  As I  My desire of learning it systematicaly drives me to apply for this master programme, I have picked up pieces of knowledge in areas like algorithms,operating systems and design patterns, and even dwelled on some topics in quite some depth. Yet I have strong desire to catch up foundamental knowledge systematically, and dig even further into Operating Systems, the most delicate compilation of designs and patterns, the practises combining practics with theory. The most down-to-earth yet most sophiscated coding practises.


Here are stories how I become a programmer. Driven by adventurous and romantic nature, I chose to to work in Nigeria on importing and logistics area as my first job after I graduated from Univerity as a Chemistry majored student. However working far away from home is more than romance and adventure, I tried to overcome lonliness and monotonous lifestye by teaching myself Python and some basic Frontend skills. At the same time Internet industry was surging and I see opportunities of becoming a programmer. When I finished 2 year journey in Africa, I returned to Shenzhen,China.

 Then I became a full-time developer in a sensors manufacture company where I learned how to programme using Go and for the first time created real industry software for cluster receptors management. With this experience, I got enrolled by Oppo, the smart phone company, and have worked there ever since as a backend service developer. My job is to provide services for security management mainly in anti-intrusion and anti-reverse-engineering. Overall, my language tool kits contents Python,Go,MySQL,HTML,CSS,FLask etc.

With my work experience, I am confident that i am qualified for this master program. I wish this education supplement could relieve me from the idea# of 'What if i had learned CS from the basics'#. I want to study this from an academic perspective to gain an #全局的系统的认知和视角.
