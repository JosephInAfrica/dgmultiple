Dear admission Committee,

It is great pleasure to recommend my ex-colleague Li Jiajun to your esteemed program.

-- who I am. how do I know him. 

This is kitty Chan.I work in Digitalor Ltd,a shenzhen based technology company working on tracing and protection solutions for IT assets. I had chance to work with Li Jiajun as a team during 2009-2010, when I was project manager and team leader, and him working as backend programmer. He impressed me with his enthusiasm and reliability . I really enjoyed working with him and would like to give him strong recommendation for his application.


He has good sense  He has good trade fair. he quickly nailed the demonstration software we were preparing in about 2 weeks. 
When he just joined the company. We were preparing a trade fair in New York to attend. We were striving to exhibit the newly developed pre-model of a sensor. Yet the software to control was not ready, old ones won't do because of new communication protocals. He managed to crack the protocal and built a demontration software within 2 weeks, with python and Vue framework. It was quite pleasing. It was simple and elegant, and works just fine. 

2. I give high recommendation on his creativity on problem solving. and efficiency in carry projects out. He is responsive and reliable. He gave practical advices and carry them out with quality. 

3.  middleware connecting sensors and managing states,and offer apis for upper structure? use go instead of python for purpose.  It made it easier for development managing structures.
