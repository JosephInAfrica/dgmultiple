Dear admission Committee,


This is kitty Chan.I work in Digitalor Ltd,a shenzhen based technology company working on tracing and protection solutions for IT assets. I worked with Li Jiajun during 2009-2010, when I was project manager and team leader, and him a backend programmer. He impressed me with his enthusiasm and reliability. I really enjoyed working with him and would like to give him strong recommendation for his application.

I admire his efficiency in work very much. There was a time when we strive to demonstrate a newly developed sensor product on the trade fair we were about to attend. And a demonstration software should be ready asap to make it available for demonstration. It was quite a challenge since new communication protocal is applied. He managed to finish the demo within 2 weeks. It was simple and elegant, and works just fine all through the fair event.I really appreciate his ability of working under pressure and delivering with no compromise in quality.

His growth in skills also impressed me a lot. He picked up go programming language and found good use of it in his work. I also give high recommendation on his creativity on problem solving. There are times we need to answer for personalized demands by individual customer, His tried to answer 
He gave practical advices and carry them out with quality. 

I am sure he will be a good candidate for your program.
