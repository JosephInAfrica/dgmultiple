To whom it may concerns,

I am pleased to recommend Li Jiajun for admission to a computer science graduate program.

I work at Tencent as a Senior Security Engineer and dev leader. I met Li JiaJun when I was working as a development leader for Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) at OPPO three years ago. I was his tutor and team leader for about two years (2020-2021) during which I had the opportunity to observe his daily work and review all of his code merge requests. 

He likes exploring new knowledge and diving deep into real world problems we meet in projects. Our team' work is mainly about Host Security and Network Security, and majority of his work is backend system to  and he majored in backend part.He is a quick learner, I am impressed that he soon gains considerable familiarity with all the middlewares we use in backend system, and gadgets we use in monitor debug CICD. He got familiar with project quickly.

He willingly takes on complicated tasks. When he was in charge of the backend part of HIDS, he boldly restructured code, making it cleaner and more understandable.  It is not a requisite to restructure legacy codes before implementing new features, and that requires quite intensive understanding of the whole project. He did quite drastic restructure not long after he was in charge, got rid of legacy codes, and added test cases to proof its safety. 

He has impressive programming skills in Go Programming Language. I personally like his code style. He wrote concise,  well-structured and well-tested codes, address to problem directly. His codes are quite pleasant  to review. He read code of well-known open-source projects a lot.

Besides, his is quite enthusiastic and easy-going in personality. He likes sports, and has been my gym partner when we were working together.  We had great time working out together during lunch breaks. 

Based on my observations and interactions with Jiajun, I am confident that he would make a valuable member to your computer science graduate program. I highly recommend him for admission to your computer science graduate program.

Thank you for considering my recommendation.

Sincerely,

Yang Nan
