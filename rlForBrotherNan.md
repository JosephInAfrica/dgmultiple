Letter of Recommendation for Li Jiajun's Graduate Program Application

To whom it may concerns,

I am pleased to recommend Li Jiajun for admission to a computer science graduate program.

I work at Tencent as a Senior Security Engineer and dev leader. I work with Li JiaJun when I served as a development leader for the Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) at OPPO three years ago. I was his tutor and team leader for about two years (2020-2021), allowing me to observe his daily work and review all of his code merge requests. 

Li Jiajun has a passion for exploring new knowledge and delving deep into real world problems we meet in projects. His mainly focus is in the backend system that supports all detection and monitoring features of the Security System. He is a quick learner, I am impressed that he attained good understanding of the entire project in a short period.Quite soon he gained familiarity with all the middlewares and gadgets we use use in monitoring and Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CICD). As the program advanced, his knowledge in operating systems allowed him to understand the intricacies of detecting features, which were not strictly required of him but greatly facilitated teamwork and cooperation.

He willingly takes on complicated tasks. When he was in charge of the backend part of HIDS, he boldly restructured code, making it cleaner and more understandable.  It is not a requisite to restructure legacy codes before introducing new features, and that requires comprehensive understanding of the entire project. He reorganized existing features to incoperate new ones smoothly, got rid of large chunks of legacy codes,and added test cases to ensure safety.

Li Jiajun has impressive programming skills in Go Programming Language. I personally like his code style. He wrote concise, well-structured and well-tested codes, address to problem directly. His codes are quite pleasant to review. Despite his primary responsibility in the backend service, he has quite decent front-end skills as well.

Besides, his is quite enthusiastic and easy-going in personality. He likes sports, and has been my gym partner when we were working together.  We had great time working out together during lunch breaks. 

Based on my observations and interactions with Jiajun, I am confident that he would make a valuable member to your computer science graduate program. I highly recommend him for admission to your computer science graduate program.

Thank you for considering my recommendation.

Sincerely,

Nan Yang
