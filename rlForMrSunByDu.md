Recommendation Letter

Applicant: Jiajun Lee
Recommender: Prof. Xiquan Sun

To Whom It May Concern,

I am writing to recommend Jiajun Lee, a former student of mine, for admission to the Computer Science program of your esteemed university. I am a chemistry professor working at Qingdao University, where Lee spent 4 years with me teaching him Organic Chemistry and so on.
During that time, Lee has proved to be a very enthusiastic, studious and diligent student and showed talents in many aspects such as science reasoning and logic. He aced in my courses and graduated with remarkable results. This is why, though six years have passed ever since he graduated 
and he is now no longer in chemistry but IT business, I still feel obligated and honoured to write this recommendation for him and hope he can succeed.

In our talks years later after he left Qingdao, i knew he decided to pursue a career in computer science and information technology. But i could not believe he could actually succeed because he did not have any IT background back then but only interest. Now he has worked as an IT developer for 3 years at OPPO, the smart phone company, 
and has already mastered several developing languages such as python, java and C++.  I am really impressed with his success for he studied all these skills by himself, and I am astonished as shown by him how interest can drive a man.

Lee is now dedicated and wish to go further in his career and therefore he is keen on applying this master program as he values the study of your university. I, as his former professor and friend, am confident to recommend him as he has all the things he needs to be qualified for this program whether it is his intelligence, passion or relevant
working experience.

Please do consider him. Thank you.
   
Sincerely,

Prof. Xiquan Sun
